One author seemed to describe a meeting with what they called, an 'Apostle'. They say that 4 leaders of the Sharmat met in a circle of Obsidian and an Apostle appeared before them and told them secrets. Perhaps, with some trickery and magic, you are capable of summoning one for your own purposes, though you shouldn't summon one within the Nether where they're at their most powerful."
