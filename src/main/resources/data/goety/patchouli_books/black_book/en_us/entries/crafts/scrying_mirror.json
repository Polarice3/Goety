      "text": "After many studies and experimentation with Lapis Lazuli, you've finally found the answer to this riddle. These statues are used as a means of scrying, looking at different parts of the world through the eyes of other beings. The Illagers seems to be spying on others through the use of Chickens and Cats, perhaps there's a way to spy on them back."

By having an Empty Map offhand, you managed to write down the location of a Woodland Mansion, however, you must be careful as you can either leave some remnant of your spying or an Evoker would spot your scrying!"
